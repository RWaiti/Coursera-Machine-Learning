Programming Exercise 1: Linear Regression Machine Learning por Universidade de Stanford
 
 Sendo feito em Octave 6.2.0, pois o Professor Andrew Ng percebeu que Octave fazia os alunos entederem mais a mat√©ria, mas tenho objetivo de refazer em Python.

**Exercise 1**

In this part of this exercise, you will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.
